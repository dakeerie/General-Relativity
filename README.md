## General-Relativity
A repository for my extended self-study of General Relativity over Summer 2025.
This follows my study of General Relativity as part of a lecture course taught over two semesters by Dr Norman Gray and Dr John Veitch at the University of Glasgow. 
As part of my self-study, I will consolidate the fundamentals of GR which I learned over the past academic year by completing exercises and updating my notes using "A First Course in General Relativity" by Bernard Schutz, supplemented by "General Relativity: The Theoretical Minimum" by Leonard Susskind and Andr√© Cabannes. Additionally, I'm aiming to create some sort of portfolio containing coding projects related to GR so as to have some practical experience in the subject before embarking on a final year Master's project in September 2025. This portfolio will hopefully also serve to back my application for a PhD in a field related to General Relativity (I haven't quite decided which area of the subject is for me yet) upon graduating in 2026. To do this I will first need to get used to using GitHub and VSCode in an effort to move away from solely relying on the University of Glasgow's Jupyter notebook services.
