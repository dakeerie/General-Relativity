## General-Relativity
A repository for my extended self-study of General Relativity over Summer 2025. This follows my study of General Relativity as part of a lecture course taught over two semesters by Dr Norman Gray and Dr John Veitch at the University of Glasgow. 

As part of my self-study, I will consolidate the fundamentals of GR which I learned over the past academic year by completing exercises and updating my notes using "A First Course in General Relativity" by Bernard Schutz, supplemented by "General Relativity: The Theoretical Minimum" by Leonard Susskind and André Cabannes. Additionally, I'm aiming to create some sort of portfolio containing coding projects related to GR so as to have some practical experience in the subject before embarking on a final year Master's project in September 2025. This portfolio will hopefully also serve to back my application for a PhD in a field related to General Relativity (I haven't quite decided which area of the subject is for me yet) upon graduating in 2026. To do this I will first need to get used to using GitHub and VSCode in an effort to move away from solely relying on the University of Glasgow's Jupyter notebook services.
